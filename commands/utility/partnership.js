**1. 100 - 300 ms: No Ping Required**  
Participants within this range can join sessions without any additional notifications. Your connection is optimal for gameplay, allowing you to engage fully without concerns.

**2. 300+ ms: @here Required**  
If your ping is 300 ms or higher, you must use the @here tag when participating. This helps notify other players of your connection status and allows for better management of the session.

**3. 500+ ms: @everyone Required**  
For participants with a ping of 500 ms or more, the @everyone tag must be used. This is crucial for maintaining session quality and ensuring all members are aware of potential connectivity issues.

**Conclusion**  
These requirements are in place to enhance the roleplay experience for everyone involved. If you have any questions about your ping or need assistance, please donâ€™t hesitate to reach out to the staff team.
